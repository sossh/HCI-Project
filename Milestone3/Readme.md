## User Logins

### **Student**
- **Email:** student@myumanitoba.ca  
- **Password:** 1234  
- **Access:** Student Lots / Visitor Lots

### **Staff**

### **Guest / Visitor**
- Option to continue as guest  
- **Access:** Visitor Lots only

## Parking Lots

Since this is a **vertical prototype**, our project does not fully implement all parking lots.  
We fully implement the following prototypes:

- **N Lot**
- **Q Lot**
- **Parcade**
- **U Lot**
- **P Lot**
- **K Lot**
- **AlC Lot**
